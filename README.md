# Overview

I wanted to create another game with a different programming language, and this is what I have created. I know that everything is in the console and could have been achieved elsewhere, but I wanted to do it. From learning Rust I was able to understand a few things, again not a language I can pull everything from another language, but a different similar with a cleaner dilect.

I wanted to create a puzzle escape room game. A game where the player will have to do what they can do find a way out of a mysterious room. 

I created this little game with Rust because I wanted a new language to make a small game with. 

Wanting to see it before you try it yourself, I have a video here on youTube with a few of my other projects.

# Development Environment

I used Rust, the programming language. Visual Studio Code for the text editor, and the internet to guide me through this journey.

# Future Work

* Make it outside the console would be pretty cool. 
* Allow for more places for the player to go and more locations to explore.
* Add more detail to the game, to help the player feel immersied.
